The folder 3bit_branch_prdedictor_with_benchmarking contains files which can replace files
with the same filenames in SimpleScalars simplesim-3.0 cpu simulator, and will enable the user 
to run a 3 bit single layer branch predictor on the sim-outorder cpu simulator. The files 
"full_bm.sh" and "visualize_bm.py" are benchmarking scripts which allow a user to get histograms
from the results of the simoutorder cpu simulator.
